This is a personal project where I create a password generator in Python.

There is an IsValidPassword function that checks if there are enough valid characters in the password. 
    For example, it verifies whether the password contains at least:

    1 number
    1 special character
    1 lowercase letter
    1 uppercase letter
In case the password is not valid, it will call the GeneratePassword function using Recursion.

This script will also store the pseudo-random passwords in a text file. However, it's not encrypted yet. 
I plan to add encryption later on.

I will also create a GUI and a clipboard button for the user.
